# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection System  

## **Introduction**  
Plant diseases can significantly impact agricultural productivity, making early detection essential. The **Plant Disease Detection System** is a **machine learning-based approach** that detects plant diseases from leaf images. This project leverages **deep learning** techniques using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify different plant diseases with high accuracy.  

## **Key Features**  
✅ **Image-Based Detection**: Upload an image of a plant leaf, and the model predicts the disease.  
✅ **Deep Learning Model**: Trained on **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** for accurate disease classification.  
✅ **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using **Streamlit** for easy interaction.  
✅ **Real-Time Predictions**: Provides instant disease classification based on leaf images.  
✅ **Dataset**: Utilizes **PlantVillage Dataset**, containing healthy and diseased leaf images.  

## **Tech Stack**  
🔹 **Python** - Core programming language  
🔹 **TensorFlow/Keras** - Deep learning framework  
🔹 **OpenCV** - Image preprocessing  
🔹 **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - Data visualization  
🔹 **Streamlit** - Interactive UI for the web app  

## **How It Works?**  
1️⃣ **Upload a plant leaf image** via the web interface.  
2️⃣ The image is **preprocessed** using OpenCV.  
3️⃣ The trained CNN model classifies the image into **healthy/diseased** categories.  
4️⃣ The system displays **disease name and confidence score**.
